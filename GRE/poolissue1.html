                                <li>Educational institutions have a responsibility to dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed.</li>
                                <li>Scandals are useful because they focus our attention on problems in ways that no speaker or reformer ever could.</li>
                                <li>Claim: Governments must ensure that their major cities receive the financial support they need in order to thrive.<br>Reason: It is primarily in cities that a nation's cultural traditions are preserved and generated.</li>
                                <li>A nation should require all of its students to study the same national curriculum until they enter college.</li>
                                <li>Some people believe that government funding of the arts is necessary to ensure that the arts can flourish and be available to all people. Others believe that government funding of the arts threatens the integrity of the arts.</li>
                                <li>Claim: In any field—business, politics, education, government—those in power should step down after five years.<br>Reason: The surest path to success for any enterprise is revitalization through new leadership.</li>
                                <li>In any field of endeavor, it is impossible to make a significant contribution without first being strongly influenced by past achievements within that field.</li>
                                <li>Nations should pass laws to preserve any remaining wilderness areas in their natural state, even if these areas could be developed for economic gain.</li>
                                <li>People's behavior is largely determined by forces not of their own making.</li>
                                <li>Governments should offer a free university education to any student who has been admitted to a university but who cannot afford the tuition.</li>

                                <li>Some people believe that in order to be effective, political leaders must yield to public opinion and abandon principle for the sake of compromise. Others believe that the most essential quality of an effective leader is the ability to remain consistently committed to particular principles and objectives.</li>
                                <li>Formal education tends to restrain our minds and spirits rather than set them free.</li>
                                <li>The well-being of a society is enhanced when many of its people question authority.</li>
                                <li>Governments should focus on solving the immediate problems of today rather than on trying to solve the anticipated problems of the future.</li>
                                <li>Some people believe that college students should consider only their own talents and interests when choosing a field of study. Others believe that college students should base their choice of a field of study on the availability of jobs in that field.</li>
                                <li>Laws should be flexible enough to take account of various circumstances, times, and places.</li>
                                <li>Claim: The best way to understand the character of a society is to examine the character of the men and women that the society chooses as its heroes or its role models.<br>Reason: Heroes and role models reveal a society's highest ideals.</li>
                                <li>Governments should place few, if any, restrictions on scientific research and development.</li>
                                <li>The best way to teach is to praise positive actions and ignore negative ones.</li>
                                <li>Governments should offer college and university education free of charge to all students.</li>
                                <li>The luxuries and conveniences of contemporary life prevent people from developing into truly strong and independent individuals.</li>
                                <li>In any field of inquiry, the beginner is more likely than the expert to make important contributions.</li>
                                <li>The surest indicator of a great nation is represented not by the achievements of its rulers, artists, or scientists, but by the general welfare of its people.</li>
                                <li>The best way to teach—whether as an educator, employer, or parent—is to praise positive actions and ignore negative ones.</li>
                                <li>Teachers' salaries should be based on their students' academic performance.</li>
                                <li>Society should make efforts to save endangered species only if the potential extinction of those species is the result of human activities.</li>
                                <li>College students should base their choice of a field of study on the availability of jobs in that field.</li>
                                <li>As we acquire more knowledge, things do not become more comprehensible, but more complex and mysterious.</li>
                                <li>In any situation, progress requires discussion among people who have contrasting points of view.</li>
                                <li>Educational institutions should dissuade students from pursuing fields of study in which they are unlikely to succeed.</li>
                                <li>Governments should not fund any scientific research whose consequences are unclear.</li>
                                <li>Society should identify those children who have special talents and provide training for them at an early age to develop their talents.</li>
                                <li>It is primarily through our identification with social groups that we define ourselves.

</li>
                                <li>College students should be encouraged to pursue subjects that interest them rather than the courses that seem most likely to lead to jobs.</li>
                                <li>Claim: When planning courses, educators should take into account the interests and suggestions of their students.<br>Reason: Students are more motivated to learn when they are interested in what they are studying.

</li>
                                <li>The greatness of individuals can be decided only by those who live after them, not by their contemporaries.</li>
                                <li>Students should always question what they are taught instead of accepting it passively.</li>
                                <li>The increasingly rapid pace of life today causes more problems than it solves.</li>
                                <li>Claim: It is no longer possible for a society to regard any living man or woman as a hero.<br>Reason: The reputation of anyone who is subjected to media scrutiny will eventually be diminished.	</li>
                                <li>Competition for high grades seriously limits the quality of learning at all levels of education.</li>

                                <li>Claim: We can usually learn much more from people whose views we share than from those whose views contradict our own.<br>Reason: Disagreement can cause stress and inhibit learning.</li>

                                <li>If a goal is worthy, then any means taken to attain it are justifiable.</li>
                                <li>In order to become well-rounded individuals, all college students should be required to take courses in which they read poetry, novels, mythology, and other types of imaginative literature.</li>
                                <li>In order for any work of art—for example, a film, a novel, a poem, or a song—to have merit, it must be understandable to most people.</li>
                                <li>Many important discoveries or creations are accidental: it is usually while seeking the answer to one question that we come across the answer to another.</li>
                                <li>The main benefit of the study of history is to dispel the illusion that people living now are significantly different from people who lived in earlier times.</li>
                                <li>Learning is primarily a matter of personal discipline; students cannot be motivated by school or college alone.</li>
                                <li>Scientists and other researchers should focus their research on areas that are likely to benefit the greatest number of people.</li>

                                <li>Leaders are created by the demands that are placed on them.</li>
                                <li>There is little justification for society to make extraordinary efforts—especially at a great cost in money and jobs—to save endangered animal or plant species.</li>
                                <li>The human mind will always be superior to machines because machines are only tools of human minds.</li>
                                <li>Every individual in a society has a responsibility to obey just laws and to disobey and resist unjust laws.</li>
                                <li>People who are the most deeply committed to an idea or policy are also the most critical of it.</li>
                                <li>Some people believe that society should try to save every plant and animal species, despite the expense to humans in effort, time, and financial well-being. Others believe that society need not make extraordinary efforts, especially at a great cost in money and jobs, to save endangered species.</li>
                                <li>Some people believe that the purpose of education is to free the mind and the spirit. Others believe that formal education tends to restrain our minds and spirits rather than set them free.</li>
                                <li>Some people believe it is often necessary, even desirable, for political leaders to withhold information from the public. Others believe that the public has a right to be fully informed.</li>
                                <li>Claim: Universities should require every student to take a variety of courses outside the student's major field of study.<br>Reason: Acquiring knowledge of various academic disciplines is the best way to become truly educated.</li>
                                <li>Young people should be encouraged to pursue long-term, realistic goals rather than seek immediate fame and recognition.</li>
                                <li>Governments should not fund any scientific research whose consequences are unclear.</li>
                                <li>Colleges and universities should require all faculty to spend time working outside the academic world in professions relevant to the courses they teach.</li>
                                <li>Knowing about the past cannot help people to make important decisions today.</li>
                                <li>In this age of intensive media coverage, it is no longer possible for a society to regard any living man or woman as a hero.

</li>
                                <li>We can usually learn much more from people whose views we share than from people whose views contradict our own.</li>
                                <li>The most effective way to understand contemporary culture is to analyze the trends of its youth.</li>
                                <li>People's attitudes are determined more by their immediate situation or surroundings than by society as a whole.</li>
                                <li>Claim: The best test of an argument is its ability to convince someone with an opposing viewpoint.<br>Reason: Only by being forced to defend an idea against the doubts and contrasting views of others does one really discover the value of that idea.</li>
                                <li>Nations should suspend government funding for the arts when significant numbers of their citizens are hungry or unemployed.</li>
                                <li>All parents should be required to volunteer time to their children's schools.</li>
                                <li>Colleges and universities should require their students to spend at least one semester studying in a foreign country.</li>
                                <li>Teachers' salaries should be based on the academic performance of their students.</li>
                                <li>It is no longer possible for a society to regard any living man or woman as a hero.</li>
                                <li>Some people believe that in order to thrive, a society must put its own overall success before the well-being of its individual citizens. Others believe that the well-being of a society can only be measured by the general welfare of all its people.</li>
                                <li>Some people believe that government officials must carry out the will of the people they serve. Others believe that officials should base their decisions on their own judgment.</li>
                                <li>Claim: Any piece of information referred to as a fact should be mistrusted, since it may well be proven false in the future.<br>Reason: Much of the information that people assume is factual actually turns out to be inaccurate.</li>
                                <li>Claim: Nations should suspend government funding for the arts when significant numbers of their citizens are hungry or unemployed.<br>Reason: It is inappropriate—and, perhaps, even cruel—to use public resources to fund the arts when people's basic needs are not being met.</li>
                                <li>Claim: Many problems of modern society cannot be solved by laws and the legal system.<br>Reason: Laws cannot change what is in people's hearts or minds.</li>
                                <li>Educators should take students' interests into account when planning the content of the courses they teach.</li>
                                <li>The primary goal of technological advancement should be to increase people's efficiency so that they have more leisure time.</li>
                                <li>Educators should base their assessment of students' learning not on students' grasp of facts but on the ability to explain the ideas, trends, and concepts that those facts illustrate.</li>
                                <li>Unfortunately, in contemporary society, creating an appealing image has become more important than the reality or truth behind that image.</li>
                                <li>The effectiveness of a country's leaders is best measured by examining the well-being of that country's citizens.</li>

                                <li>Colleges and universities should require their students to spend at least one semester studying in a foreign country.</li>
                                <li>Educational institutions should actively encourage their students to choose fields of study in which jobs are plentiful.</li>
                                <li>People's behavior is largely determined by forces not of their own making.</li>
                                <li>Colleges and universities should require their students to spend at least one semester studying in a foreign country.</li>
                                <li>Although innovations such as video, computers, and the Internet seem to offer schools improved methods for instructing students, these technologies all too often distract from real learning.</li>
                                <li>Universities should require every student to take a variety of courses outside the student's field of study.</li>
                                <li>The best ideas arise from a passionate interest in commonplace things.</li>
                                <li>To be an effective leader, a public official must maintain the highest ethical and moral standards.</li>
