                                 examinations in hospital emergency rooms to determine which
                                 patients merit immediate treatment and which can wait until the
                                 emergency physicians have more time to see them.</strong></p>

                              <p><strong> The pace of new technology brings a constant stream of new
                                devices to the market and many of them enjoy commercial success.
                                But analysts warn that announcing new technology too soon after
                                the introduction of a successful device can backfire: consumers may
                                resent feeling pressured to spend money to replace a device they
                                have just purchased, even if the new technology is clearly superior.
                                The result is that consumers either do not buy the old device in
                                anticipation of the new one, or they do not buy the new device out
                                of resentment over having already spent their money on the old
                                one. So if a company wishes to introduce a new device, it should
                              wait until purchases of the old device have begun to decline.</strong></p>

                                <input type="radio" name="d1" value="1"/> A. New technology often becomes less expensive after an initial

                                <input type="radio" name="d1" value="2"/> B.Media outlets such as television and magazines often report on

                                devices are still strong. <br>

                               <strong> In recent years much attention has been paid to distilling those
                                factors that create a positive work environment for corporate
                                employees. The goal ultimately is to discover what allows some
                                companies to foster high employee morale while other companies
                                struggle with poor productivity and high managerial
                                turnover. Several theories have been posited, but none has drawn
                                as much interest from the corporate world, or has as much promise,
                                as value congruence, which measures the "fit" between an
                                  employee's values and those of co-workers and the company itself.
                                  Value congruence can be broken into three main
                                  subcategories: person-environment ("P-E"), person-person ("P-P"),
                                  and perceptual fit ("PF"). Person-environment congruence refers to
                                  a harmony between the personal values of the employee and
                                  corporate culture of the company in which he or she works.
                                  Someone with a high P-E congruence feels personally in tune with
                                  his company's stated policies and goals. Conversely, someone with
                                  a low P-E congruence feels a sense of disharmony between his own
                                  values and the stated policies and goals of his company. A high P-P
                                  congruence indicates a sense of solidarity with one's co-workers in
                                  terms of shared values and goals. A low P-P congruence indicates a
                                  sense of isolation from co-workers brought about by an absence of
                                  shared values. Finally, strong PF suggests a strong correspondence
                                  between the values that an employee perceives his company to
                                  have (whether or not the company actually does) and the values
                                  that his co-workers perceive the company to have (again, whether
                                  or not it actually does). A weak PF implies that an employee's
                                  perception of his company's values differs significantly from that of
                                  his co-workers.
                                  Research has shown that P-E and PF congruence are
                                  important measures of employee satisfaction, commitment, and
                                  likelihood of turnover, while P-P congruence has little bearing on
                                  these parameters. Moreover, PF is especially important in
                                  establishing harmonious relations between workers and
                                  managers. These measures give corporations a robust paradigm for
                                  long-term personnel planning and productivity potentials: they allow
                                  companies to discover dysfunctional work relationships and clarify
                                  misperceived company policies and goals. With these tools in hand,
                                  companies can look forward to increased employee satisfaction and,
                                  ultimately, improved company performance.</strong>

     <strong>Absenteeism among employees has decreased steadily over the
     past several years. Two possible explanations have been offered.
     First, improved health insurance has allowed employees to maintain
     better health. Second, improved working conditions have improved
     morale, leading to less desire to avoid work. However, since
     absenteeism has also decreased at companies with poor or no
     health insurance and poor working conditions, one must conclude
     that the cause of the decrease is the increased tendency of
     employers to deduct missed days from employees' paychecks.<br>
     12.)Which of the following indicates a flaw in the reasoning above?</strong><br>
     <input type="radio" name="l1" value="1"/> A. Employees who lack health insurance often have low morale.  <br>

    <strong> 13.)Zoologists warn of an imminent surge in the number of animal
     species that will become extinct within this century. They caution
     that the rate of extinction will only increase. They are wrong,
     however. One need only consider the information gathered on
     insects: 47 species of North American insect vanished between 1900
     and 1950, but only 23 species of such insects became extinct

    <strong> In response to the increasing cost of producing energy through
     traditional means, such as combustion, many utility companies have
     begun investing in energy sources such as wind and solar power,
     hoping someday to rely on them completely and thus lower energy
     costs. The utility companies claim that these sources require an
     initial outlay of funds for construction and materials but then only a
     modest amount for maintenance. This makes them more economical
     than nonrenewable sources such as gas, oil, and coal, whose prices
     can fluctuate dramatically according to availability.<br>  14.) The claim of the utility companies presupposes which of the
     following?</strong><br>
     <input type="radio" name="l21" value="1"/> A. The public will embrace the idea of wind and solar power.  <br>	
     <input type="radio" name="l21" value="2"/> B. No new deposits of gas, oil, and coal will be discovered in the

     <input type="radio" name="l21" value="3"/> C. Weather patterns are consistent and predictable  <br>	
     <input type="radio" name="l21" value="4"/> D.The necessary technology for conversion to wind and solar
     power is not more expensive than the technology needed for
     energy created through combustion.  <br>

    <strong> Sarah Meyers McGinty, in her useful new book Power Talk: Using
     Language to Build Authority and Influence, argues that while the
     simple lingual act of declaring power does not help a powerless
     person gain influence, well-considered linguistic techniques and
     maneuvers do. McGinty does not dispute the importance of factors
     such as expertise and ability in determining stature, but argues
     persuasively that these power determinants amount to little in a
     person unable to communicate effectively. Management theorists
     share McGinty’s view that communication is essential for success
     and many surveys have shown that the ability to communicate
     effectively is the characteristic judged by managers to be most
     critical in determining promotability.
     McGinty divides speech into two categories: "language from
     the center" and "language from the edge". In McGinty's words,
     "Language from the center makes a speaker sound like a
     leader.” McGinty suggests that not only is language from the center
     for those in high positions of power, but it is also for those of lower
     ranks who wish to gain more power and credibility. A speaker using
     language from the center exhibits the following: he directs rather
     than responds; he makes statements rather than asks questions; he
     contradicts, argues, and disagrees; he uses his experience
     persuasively; and he maintains an air of impersonality in the
     workplace. McGinty suggests that the use of language from the
     center can alter or create a new balance of power. These assertions
     are supported by studies that show that people accept leadership
     from those they perceive to be experts.
     Language from the edge stands in stark contrast to language
     from the center. Language from the edge is careful, exploratory,
     and inquiring. It is inclusive, deferential, and collaborative. A
     speaker using language from the edge responds rather than directs;
     asks questions; strives to make others feel heard and protected;
     and avoids argument. The main purpose of language from the
     center is to claim authority for a speaker, while language from the
     edge strives to build consensus and trust. McGinty argues that true
     power comes from a deep understanding of when to use which style
     and the ability to use both as necessary.
     What distinguishes McGinty’s discussion of effective
     communication is her focus on communication skills as a way of
     gaining power; this focus is in contrast with most general
     management theory, which focuses on communication skills as a
     way of preventing misunderstandings, avoiding conflict, and
     fostering interpersonal relationships. McGinty, however, holds that
     language not only helps maintain relationships but also lends
     authority. According to Power Talk, effective communication skill “is
     an understanding of how situation shapes speech and how speech
     shapes situation” and “an understanding of how speech styles and
     the forces that affect those styles . . . can build your authority, and
     enhance your credibility and impact.”<br>

                                <strong>  Recently, many critics of the U.S. government have pointed out
that this country is the only industrialized nation without a national
vaccine laboratory and suggested that this lack makes the American
public more vulnerable than other advanced nations to diseases
such as avian flu or other flu epidemics. When asked at a press
conference, a government official said these critics were disloyal and
thus wrong about the public’s vulnerability. To support his claim, he
cited the international preeminence of American doctors and
hospitals as well as the middle ranking of the United States among
United Nation member nations in the health categories of infant
mortality, life span, and nutrition. He also added that all of the
Europeans that he knew preferred to undergo major medical
treatments in the United States rather than in the socialized medical
systems in place in their home countries.<br>

								<p>
  </p>
								  <input type="radio" name="s" value="1"/> A.  The official accepts that the quality of physicians and hospitals

								  <input type="radio" name="s" value="2"/> B.  The critics could be disloyal but not wrong.<br>	
								  <input type="radio" name="s" value="3"/> C.  The Europeans that the official cited are overwhelmingly
								  wealthy males over the age of fifty.<br>	
								  <input type="radio" name="s" value="4"/> D.  The official relies on health statistics that are based on a
								  complete accounting of deaths, injuries, and illnesses suffered
								  by the American public from all causes, including the ten
								  percent attributable to infectious diseases.<br> 	 
								  <input type="radio" name="s" value="5"/> E.  The UN health ranking that the official cited is based on an
								  almost complete survey of the nations of the world.<br>

								  learned to think of themselves as musically inept, these children do
								  not devote any time to music and thus deprive themselves of the
