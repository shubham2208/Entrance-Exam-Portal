                              <p align="justify" ><strong>In April 1841, medical missionary Reverend Peter Parker, M.D.
                                addressed an enthusiastic audience gathered at a special meeting of
                                the Boston Medical Association. His subject was &quot;the condition and
                                prospects of the hospitals of China.&quot; He described his own work at
                                the hospital he had established in the foreign factory district outside
                                the city walls of Canton where he offered free treatment for both
                                rich and poor. At P’u Ai I Yuan (Hospital of Universal Love, as it was
                                known in Chinese) Parker and his colleagues used western surgical
                                techniques as a means to facilitate religious conversion. Medicine,
                                Parker believed, could be the &quot;handmaid of religious truth,&quot; and he
                                held regular religious services for his patients.
                                While he had, at best, modest success attracting converts to
                                Christianity, the hospital had fostered tremendous goodwill among
                                the Chinese. It was a bright spot amid the gloomy period of
                                Western-Chinese tension that led to the outbreak of the Opium
                                Wars between Great Britain and China. Forced to flee Canton
                                because of these rising hostilities, Parker returned to the United
                                States to raise money and interest in his operations. In the spring of
                                1841, he spoke to many religious societies, a few medical bodies,
                                and even the United States Congress, where he preached to
                                members of the House and Senate and lobbied legislators on the
                                need for diplomatic relations with China.
                                In his talks, Parker described the state of medical and
                                surgical knowledge--or, rather, scientific ignorance--in China.<br>
                                Despite the surgical feats of legendary ancient doctors like Hua T’o
                                of the third century A.D., surgery did not develop to any great
                                extent in China. Some accounts attribute this to Confucian precepts
                                about the integrity of the body and proscriptions against any form of
                                pharmacological tendencies within traditional Chinese medicine and
                                a preference for moxas and other caustic plasters
                                Whatever the cause, it was undoubtedly the case that
                                Parker’s surgical practice tapped into a huge unmet need. Almost as
                                soon as he opened his Ophthalmic Hospital in Canton, as it was
                                known in English, he acquired a reputation as a surgeon of such skill
                                that the hospital quickly became a general hospital. Parker and his
                                small staff handled thousands of cases each year, treating more
                                than fifty thousand cases by the 1850s.His hospital became the
                                model for other medical missions, and Parker and his British
                                colleagues formed the Medical Missionary Society of China to
                                coordinate the efforts of all the western hospitals springing up in the
                                trading ports of Asia. Parker earned his reputation performing
                                operations to remove tumors and cataracts--forms of surgery with
                                relatively good odds of success and ones that could be accomplished
                                quickly, important in an era without anesthetics. Because of the
                                absence of surgery in China, a large number of patients were
                                afflicted with mature tumors (typically five to thirty-five years old)
                                of a size seldom seen in Europe or the United States. Parker was
                                able to help these patients in ways previously thought impossible in
                                China. He has thus been credited with bringing Western medicine to
                              the most populous country on Earth.</strong></p>

on financing. Many claim that pouring more money into the public
schools will improve student performance. However, the only way to

employees rather than the students.

   <strong> When they first arrived in America as slaves in the 1600's, Africans
joined a society that was divided between master and white
servants brought from Europe. In most parts of the South, some of
these first African slaves became free, either through escape or
through emancipation by their owners. It is therefore a
misconception that all African Americans in the pre-Civil War South
were slaves. Many researchers have also assumed that these free
African Americans were the offspring of white slave owners who
took advantage of their female slaves. However, these cases
represent only a small minority of free African Americans in the
South. Most free African Americans were actually the descendants of
African American men and white servant women.
In fact, despite the efforts of the various colonial legislatures,
white servant women continued to bear children by African
American fathers through the late seventeenth century and well into
the eighteenth century. It appears that they were the primary
source of the increase in the free African American population for
this period. Over two hundred African American families in Virginia
descended from white women. Forty-six families descended from
freed slaves, twenty-nine from Indians, and sixteen from white men
who married or had children by free African American women. It is
likely that the majority of the remaining families descended from
white women since they first appear in court records in the mideighteenth
century when slaves could not be freed without
legislative approval, and there is no record of legislative approval for
their emancipations.
The history of free African Americans families in colonial New
York and New Jersey, by contrast, is quite different from that of free
African Americans in the South. Most were descended from slaves
freed by the Dutch West India Company between 1644 and 1664 or
by individual owners. Researchers have studied these families,
especially a group of fourteen families that scholars have traced
through at least three generations. None of the fourteen families
appears to be descended from a white servant woman and an
African American man. However, Lutheran church records in the
eighteenth century show a few couples like this having children
baptized.<br>
