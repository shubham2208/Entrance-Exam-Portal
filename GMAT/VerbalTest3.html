                             <p><strong> Concord staked its claim to be the birthplace of Independence
during the celebration of "America’s jubilee" on April 19, 1825, the
fiftieth anniversary of Concord Fight. Concord was then an
expansive town of nineteen hundred inhabitants, thriving with crafts
and trade in the village and surrounded by farms prospering on
demand from rising urban centers in the long boom that
accompanied the opening phase of the Industrial Revolution in the
Northeast. It also occupied a prominent place on the political
landscape; as a shire town, where the county courts convened, it
had risen into a leading center of Middlesex County, and its
politicians were major players on that stage. Economic and political
ambitions, as well as pride in the past, drove the insistence that
Concord was the "first site of forcible resistance to British
aggression."
A decade later, by the mid-1830s, with over two thousand
inhabitants, Concord was probably at its political and economic
pinnacle. The central village hosted some nine stores, forty shops,
four hotels and taverns, four doctors and four lawyers, a variety of
county associations, a printing office and a post office.
Manufacturing was humming, too, with a growing mill village in the
west part of town, along the quick-running Assabet River, and rising
producers of carriages and chaises, boots and shoes, bricks, guns,
bellows, and pencils.
But a good many people were left out of the prosperity. In
what was still a farming town, 64 percent of adult males were
landless, while the top tenth of taxpayers, some fifty men,
controlled nearly half the wealth. Those who failed to obtain a stake
in society, native and newcomer alike, quickly moved on. The ties
that once joined neighbors together were fraying. On the farms, the
old work customs -- the huskings, roof-raisings, and apple bees --
by which people cooperated to complete essential chores gave way
to modern capitalist arrangements. When men needed help, they
hired it, and paid the going rate, which no longer included the
traditional ration of grog. With a new zeal for temperance,
employers abandoned the custom of drinking with workers in what
had been a ritual display of camaraderie. There was no point in
pretending to common bonds.
With the loosening of familiar obligations came
unprecedented opportunities for personal autonomy and voluntary
choice. Massachusetts inaugurated a new era of religious pluralism
in 1834, ending two centuries of mandatory support for local
churches. Even in Concord, a slim majority approved the change,
and as soon as it became law, townspeople deserted the two
existing churches -- the Unitarian flock of the Reverend Ripley and
an orthodox Calvinist congregation started in 1826 -- in droves. The
Sabbath no longer brought all ranks and orders together in
obligatory devotion to the Word of God. Instead, townspeople
gathered in an expanding array of voluntary associations -- libraries,
lyceums, charitable and missionary groups, Masonic lodges,
antislavery and temperance societies, among others -- to promote
diverse projects for the common good. The privileged classes,
particularly the village elite, were remarkably active in these
campaigns. But even as they pulled back from customary roles and
withdrew into private associations, they continued to exercise public
power.

have focused on the rise of job outsourcing, few have mentioned the
sharp fall of talent “insourcing,” or the drop in enrollment of foreignborn
graduate students since 2001, and its dire results. The
decrease of such insourcing will hurt America’s competitiveness in
basic research and applied technology, with serious consequences
for years to come. The de-internationalization of the graduate
programs across the country will also negatively affect the global
outlook and experience of the American students remaining in those
programs; they will not have the opportunity to learn about foreign
cultures directly from members of those cultures. What
distinguishes the decline of talent insourcing from the rise of job
outsourcing is that the former can be easily rectified by a policy

     12.)Life in an urban center, with daily experiences of subways,
crowded sidewalks and dense living, provides countless
opportunities for social contact and connection. Exurban life, by
contrast, exists in the openness of freeways and one-acre lots,

dwellers more frequently express feelings of isolation.

    <strong> Before the age of space exploration, the size and composition of the
moon's core were astronomical mysteries. Astronomers assumed
that the moon's core was smaller than that of the Earth, in both
relative and absolute terms -- the radius of the Earth's core is 55
percent of the overall radius of the Earth and the core's mass is 32
percent of the Earth's overall mass -- but they had no way to verify
their assumption. However, data gathered by Lunar Prospector have
now given astronomers the ability to determine that the moon's
core accounts for 20 percent of the moon's radius and for a mere 2
The data have been used in two ways. In the first method,
scientists measured minute variations in radio signals from Lunar
Prospector as the craft moved towards or away from the Earth.
These variations allowed scientists to detect even the slightest
changes in the craft's velocity while the craft orbited the moon.
These changes resulted from inconsistency in the gravitational pull
of the moon on the craft, and permitted scientists to create a
"gravity map" of both near and far sides of the moon. This map, in
turn, revealed to scientists the distribution of the moon's internal
mass. Scientists were then able to determine that the moon has a
small, metallic core, which, if composed mostly of iron, has a radius
of approximately 350 kilometers. The second method involved
examining the faint magnetic field generated within the moon itself
by the moon's monthly passage through the tail of the Earth's
magnetosphere. This approach confirmed the results obtained
through examination of the gravity map.
The size and composition of the moon's core are not
academic concerns; they have serious implications for our
understanding of the moon's origins. For example, if the moon and
Earth developed as distinct entities, the sizes of their cores should
be more comparable. In actuality, it seems that the moon was once
part of the Earth and broke away at an early stage in the Earth's
evolution, perhaps as the result of a major asteroid impact. The
impact could have loosened iron that had not already sunk to the
core of the Earth, allowing it to form the core around which the
moon eventually coalesced.</strong></p>
